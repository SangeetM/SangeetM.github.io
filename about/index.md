Hi friends, my name is Sangeet Moy Das and welcome to my blog! 

I [build things](https://github.com/SangeetM).

I started this site to tell the story of my tech journey. I believe in
**technology that is open, enabling, and life-giving**. I aspire to usher that
potential&mdash;even for just a tiny bit.  There is still a long way to go, and
this site records my progress. 

Here, you'll find some of my **thoughts, works, and notes** on machine learning, software
development, systems, and research. I hope that
you'll spend a nice time here, so go grab yourself a cup of coffee and feel
free to look around! 

## Background

I'm currently a Data Scientist at [Mu Sigma Inc.](https://mu-sigma.com/), world's largest pureplay analytics company, HQ in Bengaluru, India.

Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from [SOA
University](https://soa.ac.in), where I did some research on medical image data using unsupervised learning techniques.

I'm interested in problems concerning machine learning and its applications,
especially those that deal with its deployment, engineering, and use.
Furthermore, I'm also learning about distributed systems and infrastructure. 

Lastly, I'm well-involved in open-source and has authored several projects like
- [muHVT](https://github.com/Mu-Sigma/muHVT/)
- TBD
