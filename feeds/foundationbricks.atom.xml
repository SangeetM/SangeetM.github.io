&lt;li&gt;This team was tasked with building and maintaining tools using R and R-shiny that would allow an analyst to run data exploration, analysis, and machine learning pipelines without having to write any code. My contribution to the group was the design and implementation of tools that would allow users to run a wide array of exploratory, regression and segmentation algorithms on their data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To execute this project, I had to learn the intricacies of setting up proper ML pipelines which included nuances about the train, test validation sets, feature selection, feature engineering and transformation, performance metrics, diagnostic visualizations, ensembling techniques, statistical tests, and the knowledge about properly using every algorithm available to the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Along the way, I also picked up the skills and practices used in the standard software development life cycle and working in a 5 member development team. This included weekly build releases and product support functions&lt;/li&gt;
