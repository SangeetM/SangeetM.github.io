# SangeetM.github.io

This is the source code for my [blog](https://sangeetm.github.io) which has been forked and modified from [blog](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io). It's a static website powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

## Set-up

Make sure that you have bundler and Ruby in your system:

```shell
gem install bundler
```

Then, build the dependencies and call `jekyll serve`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sangeetm/sangeetm.github.io.git 
cd sangeetm.github.io/
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

The page, by default, should be running at [localhost:4000](localhost:4000)
