Below is a list of my research publications. Although they are very few because of the nature of my work, I still plan to publish regularly going forward in 2021-2022 session:

- [muHVT: Case based computational geometry modeling toolkit using R](https://youtu.be/K-eEfnWBE8s) at _useR! 2020 The R User Conference_, July 2020 (Zubin Dowlaty, Sangeet Moy Das, and Shubhra Prakash) 
<br>
  - Enterprises currently employ a variety of mathematical models to understand complex longitudinal data. These data sets are usually multilevel, aggregated from cases into hierarchical panel data sets. 
  - Using our muHVT package, we study the traces of a systemâ€™s complexity at the case level using novel non-parametric methods found in the computational geometry discipline. The outputs are 2D hierarchical maps visualized with Voronoi cells where each case is located, further their movement from cell to cell are visualized. 
  - These movements form trajectories, vector fields can be calculated by cell. Cases are projected via Sammons algorithm into 2D, with up to 3 hierarchies. The method and package supports multivariate, high dimensional data. Using the Sammons projection method, the resulting map has spatial meaning and is highly visual for interpretation. 
  Non-linear dynamics can be clearly identified and displayed as a layer in the tessellation. A shiny application using muHVT will be showcased, actual case data will be utilized to educate on the novel nature of this method.

- [muHVT: Constructing Hierarchical Voronoi Tessellations and Overlay Heatmap for Data Analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/muHVT/) at _The R Project for Statistical Computing_, March, 2020. (Sangeet Moy Das, Zubin Dowlaty, and Avinash Joshi)
<br> 
  - Constructing hierarchical voronoi tessellations for a given data set and overlay heatmap for variables at various levels of the tessellations for in-depth data analysis. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram> for more information."
