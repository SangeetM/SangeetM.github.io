- Individual Contributor tasked with research & development of an R CRAN package named muHVT for visualization and analysis of multivariate data by constructing Hierarchical Voronoi Tessellations using vector quantization and overlay heatmap to find trend & anomaly detection
- This required a vast amount of research in the field of Computational Geometry and quickly catching up with D3.js
- Along the way, I also built an accompanying R shiny dashboard to use the above package and recreated the visualization in D3.js for interactivity in for two-dimensional and three-dimensional topographical surface views
