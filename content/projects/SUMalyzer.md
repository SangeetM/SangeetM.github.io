SUMalyzer is a tool to collect, manage and analyze medical data. The goal is to gain insights by observing long term patterns revealed by your personal data. I started this app to monitoring the development of some medical metrics regarding to asthma and allergies, but SUMalyzer is suitable to capture any metric since it is basically tracking text snippets associated to a patient and a location.
