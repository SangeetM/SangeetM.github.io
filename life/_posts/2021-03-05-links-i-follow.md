Some people ask me where I get my newsworthy tech stuff: I'd say a large
part of it is from podcasts. Usually, I listen to them when I'm doing some
monotonous activity&mdash; jogging, walking to work, doing groceries, etc.
They allow me to learn new things and turn my *unknown unknowns* into *known
unknowns.*[^1] Plus, it's a great way to add some sound in my painfully quiet
room! 

Below are some of the tech related podcasts that I regularly follow (in no particular order): 


1. [**Lex Fridman**](TBD) (Machine Learning)
1. [**Machine Learning Street Talks**](TBD) (Machine Learning)

Other podcasts I listen to occasionally:

- [**Talking Machines**](https://www.thetalkingmachines.com/home?context_entity_type=node&context_entity_id=14033): another well-produced podcast geared for more academic machine learning researchers. [Neil Lawrence](http://inverseprobability.com/) is fantastic. Listen to his episode on [ML and Society](https://robohub.org/talking-machines-machine-learning-and-society-with-neil-lawrence/).
- [**Talk Python to Me**](https://talkpython.fm/) (Python). TPTM is probably one of the best Python podcasts around. For each episode, a guest comes in and talks about their Python journey, things they've built, and future directions of their work. The host, Mike Kennedy, gives really insightful discussions (and [also a friendly guy on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mkennedy)). If you're a data scientist, web developer, or a Python newbie, there's a TPTM episode for you.

Non-tech podcasts:

- [**Beer Biceps**](TBD)
- [**10% Happier Podcast with Dan Harris**](https://www.10percenthappier.com/podcast/)

## FAQ

- **That's so many podcasts! How do you listen to them all?** I definitely
    can't and to be honest I have a backlog of episodes to listen to. The key
    is not to be overburdened by too much information. Just listen when
    you can: *you do this for leisure, not for work*. 
- **When do you listen to podcasts? I don't have time for that!** I listen when
    I'm doing something routine: walking around the house (~15 minutes), long walks (~90
    minutes), grocery (~2 hr). It's more on passive listening, just like
    turning on the radio, only difference is that you can curate what you hear.
- **What apps do you use?** Right now it's mostly from YouTube. Earlier I used to use Audible for listening to books.
